## project base

- upstream project: https://github.com/ppy/osu
- this repository tracks and extends upstream osu!lazer behavior

## important server note

We have temporarily disabled logins as this client still connects to osu! servers.
When bypassed, osu!bancho prohibits score submission as this client is modified.

## Build Instructions (desktop)


Debug Builds
    Building from `root` of this repository:

```bash
  dotnet build osu.Desktop/osu.Desktop.csproj -c Debug
```

publish debug builds:

```bash
dotnet publish osu.Desktop/osu.Desktop.csproj -c Debug -r win-x64 --self-contained false -o ../builds/windows-debug-v2

## Bug Reports

If your issue is replicable in the standard client, Please [open an issue upstream instead.](https://github.com/ppy/osu/issues/new/choose)

Do not mention "Deltalazer" on your upstream bug report, as deltalazer (currently) has no affiliation with the osu!team. Doing so may be potentially disrespectful to them OR this fork.

If your issue is NOT replicable by the standard client, you may report the issue [here](https://github.com/deltalazer/delta/issues/new/choose), however keep in mind that:

1. This client is very experimental
2. Most issues are likely to already have a report, please check the Issues tab! 

### Please include:

- Your beatmap file and exact section/hitobject settings used
- The expected behavior compared to the actual behavior
- Your client's crash logs/stack trace if available
- Your build type [Debug or Release]

## Contributing

Community contributions are welcome and encouraged!!

- Open an issue for any bug reports
- Open a discussion for feature and/or design proposals
- Open a pull request for any changes to the code base
For Developers: Please include tests where possible for regression safety
